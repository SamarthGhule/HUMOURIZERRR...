# HUMOURIZERRR...
HUMOURIZERRR... is a simple web application that displays random jokes to users. It is typically built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and uses an external API. When the user clicks a button or loads the page, the application fetches a random joke and displays it on the webpage.

A random joke generator using an API, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript fetches jokes from an external joke API and displays them on a webpage. Here's a brief overview of how it works:

HTML: The HTML file contains the structure of the webpage, including a container to display the joke and a button to trigger the API call to get a new joke.

CSS: The CSS file styles the webpage, ensuring it looks visually appealing with appropriate fonts, colors, and layout.

JavaScript: The JavaScript code handles the API call to the joke API and updates the joke on the webpage dynamically.

API: An external joke API is used to fetch random jokes. The API returns a random joke in JSON format, which the JavaScript code extracts and displays on the webpage.
